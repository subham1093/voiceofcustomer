"I got my new UN65JS8500 last Tuesday after I accidentaly broke my XBR55X850A, well accidents happens.",Sentiment,
"Anyway, Samsung's new screen panels are called SUHD.",Feature,
The JS8500 includes the One Connect Mini as oppose to the 9000 series which include the One Connect Box with more input options and future proof of the hardware.,Feature,Comparison
"Also this set has a LED Edge-Lit backlight display as his more expensive brother the JS9000, only",Feature,Comparison
the JS9500 has a Full Arrange Local Dimming capabilities that will have superior HDR performance.,Feature,
"And last but not least is the obvious, is not curved but Samsung was extremely wise to keep the flat version only to the US market, but all of the other great features from the 9000 series are present.",Feature,
Once you properly calibrate your set be ready to be amazed.,Sentiment,
"I watched The Dark Knight, Pacific Rim and Transformers 4: Age of Extinction, three of my favorite Reference movies on Blu Ray.",Sentiment,
The new OS is easy to navigate and use.,Feature,
I considered both the JS9000 & 9500 but I'm not a fan of curved TV's.,Feature,Comparison
I did way to many hours of research leaning towards discounted 2014 models as I'm basically done paying extra for being an early adopter of new technology.,Sentiment,
In the end I just couldn't pull the trigger on settling for what my eyes perceived to be an inferior picture to the JS8500.,Feature,Comparison
I needed a TV now and am willing to watch the price drop in the coming year.,Sentiment,
If your considering this TV my recommendation is go for it!,Sentiment,
I'll update this review after I get more time using this TV.,Other,
I've attached a photo of a youtube 4k video taken with my samsung S5 phone.,Other,
I purchased this TV about 2 weeks ago and I can't say enough good things about it.,Sentiment,
The picture is so clear that it makes you wonder how you lived with 1080p beforehand.,Feature,
But I will warn you it takes some time of working through all of its features before you get this picture.,Sentiment,
If you have a Xbox One or PS4 you will see a drastic difference as well.,Sentiment,
I play Destiny on Xbox One and it looks amazing.,Sentiment,
One thing you will have to do with FPS or action games is switch over to game mode every time.,Sentiment,
Without this switch you will notice a substantial lag that will make for a not so pleasant gaming experience.,Enhancement,
Once you switch over to game mode though it looks amazing.,Feature,
I did an awful lot of research before buying a TV in this price range and through all my reading I saw that Hight Dynamic Range (HDR) was extremely important to future proof your investment and this TV has it.,Feature,Sentiment
The other model I looked very closely at was the new Sony model in the same 55 inch set.,Sentiment,Comparison
Both had amazing picture but the HDR coupled with the slightly better picture in my opinion I chose this model.,Feature,Comparison
I know many people say there isn't much 4K content out right now and that is fairly true.,Other,
But I have watched a fair number or blu rays the past two weeks and they look stunning.,Sentiment,
I turned on the UHD upscale and it creates a far better picture than my prior 50 inch LED 1080p TV.,Feature,Comparison
One that was particularly amazing was Lucy.,Sentiment,
The colors are so vibrant its hard to look away.,Feature,
The Samsung UN65JS8500FXZA TV arrived on November 12.,Other,
They were serious flashlight issues emitting from the sides and bottom of the TV screen (see attached pictures).,Issue,
This TV is an LED edge lit TV.,Feature,
The edge lighting was clearly visible.,Enhancement,
This seems to be a common problem with this model.,Sentiment,
I've seen other people complain about this issue online.,Sentiment,
I filed a support ticket at Samsung.com and attached the images showing the problem.,Sentiment,
I also called Sumsung Support and referenced my online support ticket ID number.,Sentiment,
"After speaking to several people and being disconnected once, Samsung arranged to have a local authorized repair technician come to my house and replace the TV screen on November 17.",Customer Service,
I was on the phone for a total of two hours with Samsung and their agents to get the entire problem resolved.,Customer Service,
"Now that the screen has been replaced, the TV looks great.",Feature,
I am very pleased with the final result.,Sentiment,
"However, the TV screen should have worked when purchased.",Other,
I should not have to replace a brand new screen.,Other,
"For that reason, I give 3 stars instead of 5.",Other,
"Okay, it is now December 30, 2015.",Other,
I have owned the TV for 6 weeks now and it works flawlessly.,Sentiment,
The best image is shown when seated directly in front of the TV.,Feature,
I attached an image showing Home Alone playing on the TV.,Other,
"Also, the 3D is awesome.",Feature,
I didn't even buy the TV for the 3D capability.,Sentiment,
But I am so happy I did.,Sentiment,
You can convert any television show or movie to 3D.,Feature,
"It does not work on 2D cartoons, but it does work with everything else.",Enhancement,
I am super pleased with the 3D functionality.,Feature,
The UN65JS8500FXZA comes with one pair of glasses.,Feature,
I bought additional open box Samsung 3D glasses online at BestBuy.com for $9.99.,Sentiment,
Please let me know if you have any questions.,Other,
I normally look to upgrade every 2-3 years and this process is usually a very simple one - checkout the offerings from Sony & Samsung and select the best option.,Sentiment,
"But other advances in technology, both those that are here and those that are arriving soon (hopefully) made this process much more involved and a bit befuddling at times.",Sentiment,
I'm still not all that sold on 4k but the best picture quality technologies are only available on 4k sets so you have to take a close look at what's available in this space.,Feature,
"And while 10-bit panels, wider color gamuts, nano-crystals/Triluminous displays, etc. are nice features, none of them would have changed my original plan for a 2014 1080P set.",Feature,
What did was HDR because I believe that could be a game changer.,Sentiment,
"It also narrowed the search down to two Samsung models, the JS8500 or JS9000, and I don't think you can go wrong with either one.",Sentiment,Comparison
The 9000 is curved and has better sound but neither of those was a concern for me.,Feature,Comparison
But it also has the full OCB for better future upgradeability so that was worth considering.,Feature,
"But you can't upgrade the panel, so I would rather use the $500 difference in price along with the future evolution kit upgrade ($400+) and whatever you can sell the JS8500 for and put that towards a new TV when the time comes.",Sentiment,
"Anyway, it's only been a few days but so far I am extremely happy with the JS8500.",Sentiment,
Setup was a breeze and the picture quality ranges from great to pick-your-own-superlative.,Feature,
Now there are a few channels that looked better on my old TV (Samsung F6300) but they don't look that great to begin with so be prepared for a few sources that will disappoint.,Enhancement,
I'm getting used to the remote but it is on the small side and won't be suitable for some folks.,Enhancement,
But any of these can be easily upgraded and are not rating factors for me.,Sentiment,
Now I'd like to mention a few setup/installation items that might save some folks a little aggravation and maybe result in more accurate reviews.,Other,
"First, I did experience one issue with this set which was some flickering/flashlighting on the bottom of the screen that was very noticeable when watching movies in letterbox format.",Sentiment,
But sometimes this is caused by the screws being over-tightened during the mfg.,Other,
"process, so I loosened the 4 bottom screws by about a 1/4 turn (one needed more) and the problem has not returned.",Sentiment,
Something to try before returning it.,Other,
"Second, if you have satellite like I do (DirecTV) you should test your signal strength to make sure you don't have any issues because this can greatly impact picture quality on any set.",Sentiment,
This is easily done under the Settings menu with DTV.,Sentiment,
You also want to make sure the cable/satellite box is configured to allow the TV to do ALL the upscaling/processing.,Sentiment,
With DTV this means Resolutions should all be checked with Native set to ON and screen format set to original format.,Sentiment,
"I would also recommend turning off all of the following on the TV, at least initially - Instant On/ECO settings/Smart Security/Anti-virus.",Sentiment,
"These can cause various problems with streaming, shutoffs, etc.",Other,
so try these individually after you have everything else setup/dialed in.,Other,
I know they say you shouldn't professionally calibrate it until after 100 hours so maybe this is related.,Other,
I also need to give a couple major kudos to Amazon.,Other,
"First, they double boxed the shipment which is a service that some places charge $30-75 for and others don't even offer.",Other,
"And second, they took care of me when Samsung not only extended the original sale past 6/13, but then included a free soundbar or 24 TV with every purchase.",Other,
Still enjoying the new TV and decided to have the set calibrated.,Other,
A lot of people have reviewed this set in detail.,Other,
"Rather than repeat that, here's a few words about the One Connect Mini box that is included.",Other,
"I think most people will use this TV with one or more HDMI devices -- either an A/V receiver, set top box, Blu-Ray player, etc.",Sentiment,
"After initial setup, I got a couple of messages about problems with the HDMI connections.",Sentiment,
I think these were due to the One Connect cable being loose.,Sentiment,
"It's a tight fit, and you need to make sure it is firmly connected, with a final click.",Sentiment,
"Once I did this, I had no more such problems.",Other,
I've had the Samsung UN65JS8500 for 3 months now with no problems.,Sentiment,
Some people have been hating on the remote.,Other,
It seems pretty intuitive.,Other,
I had an issue where none of the HDMI ports were working.,Sentiment,
"I thought maybe I would need a new one-connect box to fix this, but Samsung support (1) checked that I had the latest software, and (2) had me unplug the TV while it was ON; wait a bit, then re-plug it.",Sentiment,
This cleared the problem.,Other,
 I bought this TV knowing the issues with blue corners.,Issue,
 hope this helps people looking at this TV and I am happy to answer any questions you might have as it is a big investment for most and the technology can sometimes feel intimidating to some.\,Other,
"Hoping I was not one of those people, I ended up with that set.",Sentiment,
"On top of that, the bottom left corner was not flush.",Issue,
Contacted Samsung and they deemed it to have physical damage from shipping and refused to repair it.,Customer Service,
I will not be buying another Samsung set.,Customer Service,
Their customer service is beyond horrible.,Customer Service,
They will do everything possible to deny a warranty claim.,Customer Service,
"bought this TV a month ago, and just returned it last week.",Sentiment,
(unless they were hiding with the stand.,Other,
Lets get to the BAD part.,Other,
"I can't believe that for a 2015 TV, and for this price, I would be experiencing this level of issues.",Sentiment,
"The Vizio M70-C3 i bought before this TV had way better backlight, with only 32 active LED full array zones, it out performed this samsung.",Comparison,Feature
"I really wanted to like this TV, as I have a 52 Samsung 7000 series from 9 years ago on the wall, and it is still a very good TV.",Comparison,
"I can't believe these two tv's share the same tech for the most part, aside from the smart features, 3D, form factor, inch count and the nano crystals...I decided to go with the LG 65EG9600 to squash any of my gripes...and if that TV doesn't knock my socks off, I give up.",Comparison,
"I will return it, and wait a few years.",Other,
"However, it has some drawbacks that might be significant to you, and there are other televisions that are much cheaper that you might consider.",Sentiment,
Some programs look fantastic color wise.,Feature,
"Lastly for the pros, this is a very good looking tv, with real metal around the bezel and stand, and if you care about looks, this is a nice plus to have in a set.",Feature,
"Cons: this has a very reflective screen, so if you have it in a room with lots of windows or light sources, be aware that you will see them reflected in the screen.",Enhancement,
"You can still enjoy the content, as the screen can get very bright, but if you are bothered by this be aware.",Sentiment,
"Also, this set looks weak when you move off axis, worse than others I've had.",Enhancement,
"so if you have a large room where people will be seated far off to the side, be aware, the screen gets very washed out unless you sit in front of it.",Sentiment,
"Lastly, since this is edge lit instead of back lit, black levels will not be as dark as with a back lit screen.",Enhancement,
"I find the blacks good, but not quite as good as my Vizio that is back lit.",Feature,Comparison
"So, overall for me this was a good purchase, but there are definitely drawbacks that might be important enough for you to not consider this.",Sentiment,
"For me, the pros outweigh the cons.",Other,
"As for competition, the Vizio M series is much cheaper than this, 4k and full array back lit, with good blacks and other advantages as well.",Feature,Comparison
I would check that out for sure and decide which is best for your preferences.,Sentiment,
IMO comparable Sony's or LG's are not worth considering.,Sentiment,
Good luck.,Other,
My 65 has a very obvious lighting glowing defect in the lower left and lower right corners when viewing light-colored content regardless of source.,Issue,
Looks like many other users are reporting the same thing with recently purchased TVs.,Other,
Check out the Official JS8500 thread on AVSForum for a bunch of customer photos that highlight the issue.,Sentiment,
I'm boxing it back up for a return.,Sentiment,
Let me start by saying that this TV is the best TV I have ever had.,Feature,
The picture quality is beyond what I expected!!!,Feature,
"I pick this up from Best Buy since they had there Black Friday prices available now, same as Amazon has it currently.",Sentiment,
"I can't tell you how amazed I am with TV, the black levels are great for Samsung's entry level of the SUHD brand.",Feature,
"I originally planed on getting the LG 65UF8600, but I seen that LG has a lot of back light bleeding issues, and doing more research, I found that it is not to future proof or HDR compatible.",Issue,Comparison
"Don't get me wrong, I'm a huge LG fan, my last TV before this was an 55inch LG 1080p, with this TV I have no back lighting issues.",Sentiment,
"I have only watched one 3D movie so far (Gravity), it looked amazing.",Sentiment,
"I am mad that Samsung only decided to provide one single pair of 3D glasses, provided the amount of money we are spending ($2,000+), they could at least spare another 15 or 20 bucks and provide one more pair, guess I'll be watching by myself until I get some more!!!!",Enhancement,Sentiment
I have have two Monster Black Platinum HDMI cables connected.,Sentiment,
"One to my 2014 Samsung BD-F7500 4K Up-scaling 3D Blu-Ray player, and the other to my XBox One.",Sentiment,
"These HDMI cables are the best, I highly recommend getting them, I had these for about a year now connected to my 1080p TV, and they have done wonders for the picture on that set.",Sentiment,
"The cables are about a $100 a pop (plus tax), and they are worth it.",Sentiment,
"I have one with the LED indicator ($10 more), which tells me when the signal is in SD, HD, or 4K.",Sentiment,
"I've done some calibration on my own with this TV, it doesn't need to much tuning though.",Sentiment,
All in all great TV.,Feature,
 The one connect box died just over a month after purchase.,Issue,
It will take samsung 5-15 business day to have a replacement box shipped to me.,Customer Service,
"If you were to order this tv directly through samsung's website, it'll ship w/in 1-3 business days, but the part that's essential to the tvs functionality takes anywhere from 5-15 business days?",Customer Service,
"This wouldn't be an issue if the tv had at least one hdmi input on the tv, but it doesn't so you're at the mercy of the one connect box.",Enhancement,
"If it fails then your brand new, expensive tv is useless until a replacement box is shipped to you.",Enhancement,
like to be specific when I write reviews here as too often the reviews of multiple models/products get blended together.,Other,
This review is for the Samsung UN24H4000 24-Inch 720p 60Hz LED TV; Amazon ASIN: B00KSBBGA4.,Other,
"I purchased this product on Sept 6, 2014.",Other,
I have only used this TV for one day and at this time only have it connected to an older digital cable box via a coax connection.,Sentiment,
I did use the Component connections for a DVD player and the picture quality is excellent.,Sentiment,
I will have a Mini Tivo box installed early next week and following that will have an HDMI cable tv connection.,Sentiment,
I will update my review following that.,Other,
I now have this TV connected to a Tivo Mini and the picture quality is totally excellent.,Feature,
If you are concerned about 720 vs 1080 I say don't worry.,Feature,
I have a four-year-old Visio 22 1080 TV in another location and the picture from this Samsung with 720 is just as good if not better.,Feature,Comparison
All of the ports are on a squarish panel on the rear of the TV and all face to the rear.,Feature,
"I point this out because if you plan on using a USB device (such as thumb drive) to view media, you may want to obtain a USB extension cable, because if you have the TV against a wall, or in an enclosed cabinet like I do, the rear panel may not be easily accessible.",Sentiment,
(Note that a USB extension cable is NOT the same thing as a standard USB cable.),Other,
Another reason I point this out is the Amazon photos for this product clearly show a side panel with HDMI and USB ports.,Other,
I am certain that the photos come from Samsung as the same photos are shown at BestBuy.Com and Beach Audio.,Other,
Both the shipping carton and the product label on the rear of the TV clearly identify this TV as a UN24H4000 model.,Feature,
It appears that Samsung has revised the panel configuration of this model to match the separate UN24H4500 model.,Sentiment,
"Set up was relatively simple, with the exception of a great deal of frustration mounting the TV to its base.",Feature,
This model comes with three documents: A Setup Guide; a Quick tart Guide; and a User Manual.,Feature,
All three of these are fold-outs.,Other,
"Even the User Manual is a fold-out, is 16 by 22 in size when opened, printed on both sides, and printed in tiny print.",Feature,
"Fold-outs are fine for the Setup and Quick Start guides, but I would much prefer a booklet style User Manual.",Enhancement,
The small opening and depth of the cavity makes it very difficult to aim the small screws into the small screw holes.,Enhancement,
"I had to use an set of angled hobby tweezers, and even that wasn't easy.",Sentiment,
A magnetic bit screwdriver would make it easier.,Enhancement,
I read in another review here on Amazon that you must be extremely careful with configuring the TV when you first turn it on because you only get one shot at it.,Other,
That person returned the set after a botched first attempt.,Other,
"I too had some difficulty with a setup selection as I did not know the difference between STD, IRC, and HRC for the cable setting.",Sentiment,
"I was easily able to totally reconfigure by pressing the Menu key, scrolling down to a gear-shaped icon, which is Plug & Play, then pressing the Enter key.",Sentiment,
"By the way, I later learned that the vast majority of cable tv provider's signal are STD.",Other,
The IRC and HRC are noise reduction signals used mostly with older cable technology.,Other,
Other reviewers have complained about the sound from this model.,Other,
Putting it up high like that is a real plus for the bedroom.,Sentiment,
An older Visio 22 TV with a larger bezel and front mounted speakers did not fit into that space.,Sentiment,Comparison
I use this TV in the basement with a Roku 3 while working out on my bicycle trainer.,Sentiment,
I specifically did not want a smart TV because a lot of the research I found was that most of them are laggy and freeze up.,Enhancement,Sentiment
I also plug my headphones into the remote on the Roku 3.,Sentiment,
I can't think of anything that I don't like about this TV.,Sentiment,
I would definitely buy this TV again and I probably will for the cabin.,Sentiment,
Just press a few wrong buttons and you'll figure it out.,Sentiment,
I replaced my flip phone for a not-so-smart phone (Samsung Galaxy Centura) and I replaced my old flat screen CRT TV for this.,Sentiment,
In both cases I'm getting way more bang for the buck.,Other,
My favorite things so far have to do with menu options.,Other,
4 stars easy.,Other,
If I rotate it both my wife and I can see it fine.,Sentiment,
 I bought this TV for my elderly dad for Christmas.,Sentiment,
He spends a lot of time watching TV because he is differently abled and almost unable to walk.,Sentiment,
I bought it to replace a cheap TV he bought himself when his previous TV died.,Sentiment,
"My mom doesn't like the TV noise when he's watching and she's reading in the same room, so he uses headphones.",Sentiment,
I was shocked to learn that this TV doesn't have a headphone jack.,Enhancement,
"His illness gives him cognitive and memory issues, so he can't be going into the complex menu and clicking through an elaborate system of choices simply to switch from TV speakers to headphones.",Sentiment,
"I got him an RCA adaptor, and that doesn't work.",Issue,
"I got him an optical to digital converter, and though that works, he would need to go through above described complexity when he wants to use headphones.",Issue,
Ditto bluetooth.,Other,
"It doesn't just switch back to TV speakers when you unplug them-- and I also had to buy a headphone volume control, because when you use optical out the volume goes through full blast.",Enhancement,
"I looked into hooking it up to a surround sound system, but my parents don't want speakers all over their den.",Sentiment,
"Looked into sound bars, but sound bars don't have headphone jacks.",Enhancement,
" but honestly, my Vizio's picture quality is better.",Comparison,
"Honestly, I don't recommend this TV for elderly people or anyone who wants to use headphones.",Sentiment,
Too much of a pain to find something that works.,Other,
"My dad is waiting for me to solve his problem, and I think the only realistic way to do that is to get him a different TV.",Sentiment,
My mom is threatening to plug in the old one and put this one away.,Sentiment,
Honestly I wish I'd never purchased it.,Sentiment,
Everything met,Sentiment,
This was gift for my sister in nursing home.,Sentiment,
She loves it!!!,Sentiment,
THANKS!,Other,
Bought it for my big rig and the back of the television cracked where the mounting apparatus Connect's to the TV.,Issue,
 I have two Samsung tv's and can't say anything bad about either.,Sentiment,Comparison
This one arrived very quickly and my son set it up for me.,Other,Sentiment
We needed a small TV for our kitchen.,Sentiment,
this is the smallest I found with the features I wanted.,Sentiment,
No problem getting it hooked up but Samsung helped me with the final setup.,Customer Service,
Very kind personnel to work with,Customer Service,
Don't trust Samsung with their smart TV's after what they have said about being careful on what you say around the TV since they listen in.,Other,
Watch TV.,Other,
"One Problem I have is, the TV doesn't work correctly with my DirecTV remotes.",Issue,
Samsung is one of the brands that has an issue with the power on/off along with the STB.,Sentiment,
Have to switch to TV and hit PWR to turn the TV on/off.,Enhancement,
Just an extra step that we Don't have to do with my other TV's.,Other,
"This seems to have mixed reviews, but the negative ones did not seem to apply to me.",Sentiment,
The feet are small and hardly visible so would be essentially 'invisible' if used.,Feature,
"The 'frame' around the new model is much smaller, so you could fit this in a smaller space if needed - the old one filled the space.",Feature,Comparison
The picture is very sharp.,Feature,
"I won't balance it until its on for about 50 hours, but it looks essentially the same with the contrast down to 70%.",Sentiment,
Would I buy this again?,Other,
Unquestionably.,Other,
I bought this TV before there was any feedback and found the negative feedback before it was delivered.,Sentiment,
"I must admit that, based on the prior feedback, I was concerned about the feet as I tried to assemble the TV.",Other,
It was a great buy and I am very pleased.,Sentiment,
"Additionally, be smart and don't be influenced by reviews from people who are not verified purchasers of the product. ",Other,
"Love the features, don't need a Roku now :) Very pleased with this purchase and the size is perfect for my bedroom.",Sentiment,
"Almost bought a sound bar, but for the room, I don't even need it.",Sentiment,
This tv really puts out in sound quality and volume level!,Feature,
I found pleasure with the picture/sound after changing the standard settings.,Feature,
At first I didn't have volume.,Sentiment,
"But after making those adjustments and restarting the tv, volume is great.",Other,
"I like that the tv is silent on power on/off, and it automatically shuts off if you don't select a function.",Feature,
I enjoy the energy conservation part.,Feature,
"Bought a wall mount, but unless you have a brick or concrete wall, it's unable to be used, so I have to return the mount.",Other,
"Great tv, and my 40 in living room is just as wonderful!",Feature,Comparison
I had a replacement tv delivered due to first tv being damaged in delivery,Issue,
"It took a couple weeks for the damages full effect to surface.,",Issue,
The first tv I couldn't get volume on the first power up.,Issue,
"After adjusting settings and repowering I did.,",Other,
I've had (and still have) several other Samsung TVs  and have liked them.,Sentiment,Comparison
How can a TV be slow?,Enhancement,
It's slow to turn on.,Feature,
"Remember picture tube TVs that used to take time to warm up?,",Sentiment,
"The sound quality is pretty good for a TV, and at 50% volume it's loud enough for my needs.",Feature,
"On the back, the TV has the following ports:",Other,
* two HDMI in ports,Feature,
* ANT (TV) in,Feature,
* USB 3.0,Feature,
* LAN (Local Area Network),Feature,
* Digital optical audio out,Feature,
"I've only needed to use the HDMI port, but the audio out will be useful if I ever want to upgrade to a high quality speaker system. ",Sentiment,
"Second Samsung smart TV we have bought, hooked on value!",Sentiment,
"Other one larger, but same features.",Other,Comparison
Will buy again when we are in need again,Other,
Satisfactory.,Sentiment,
"I am not real particular, just wanted a decent tv with modern features.",Sentiment,
So far I am happy with this tv & all samsung products that I have purchased.,Feature,Comparison
The tv works great!,Feature,
I needed it for my office and it is just as i was hoping for,Sentiment,
This TV is a slam dunk for the price.,Feature,
I've had mine for a little over a year now and I have had no issues to report thus far.,Sentiment,
"In a nut shell, this TV has exceeded my expectations.",Feature,
The smart function interface is a little sluggish but all apps seem to work flawlessly when called upon.,Enhancement,
"Ultimately, it comes down to how you intend to use this tv.",Other,
Invest in the sound bar and your TV watching experience will go from good to great.,Sentiment,
I bought one of the lower end samsung sound bars and the thing bumps with this setup.,Sentiment,
The only regret I have with buying this TV is not going for the model with the higher refresh rate.,Other,
I bought this tv for my son and he absolutely loves it.,Sentiment,
Every thing else very good.,Other,
"I don't have cable so since Netflix is my cable, I wish I didn't have to wait.",Sentiment,
but can be fixed by a sound bar (for the same price of the tv) In conclusion don't by this tv.,Sentiment,
Arrived on time ....,Other,
I bought this 32 TV for my wife and she is using this as a computer monitor,Sentiment,
We needed a second TV,Sentiment,
Bought as a gift.,Sentiment,
My sister loves it!,Sentiment,
Love the TV so much that we have bought two.,Sentiment,
The samsang TVs are the best...,Sentiment,
So many choices when looking to buy a new TV for my bedroom.,Other,
I started comparing TVs,Other,
But then I began to look at this LG TV more closely,Other,
And now I can say that I am not disappointed with my choice.,Sentiment,
This TV will not disappoint,Sentiment,
Great TV for my small living room.,Sentiment,
very light (if you need to move it - I had a 28 Sharp TV a while back that was twice as heavy);,Feature,
Pros: crystal clear picture; headphone jack - which I use a lot; easy to use settings;,Feature,
"And probably more that I cannot think of, and probably much more that is technical that I am not really into.",Sentiment,
:-),Sentiment,
easy to install stand; speakerphones are surprisingly clear for such a small TV; three HDMI ports - using one for ROKU 2 and one for cable TV;,Feature,
Cons: none that I have noticed.,Other,
"I am enclosing three pictures, though the pictures do not fully show how clear the TV picture is.",Other,
Highly recommended for small spaces. ,Sentiment,
One reason I purchased this product was that the stand in the middle of the TV offers a small footprint vice the newer TVs with two stands located on each end.,Feature,Sentiment
I purchased a table (also from Amazon) with a 12 X 24 inch top.,Other,
The table might be able to support the weight of a truck but I would need a larger table to place a two stand version TV on top of.,Sentiment,
This LG product is sturdy and offers a great picture with just a standard coaxial cable and non HDTV cable box. ,Feature,
"Purchased this TV from Amazon, as usual good delivery service.",Other,
Bought this to replace the bedroom TV that died.,Sentiment,
Now that I have calibrated this set the picture rates as excellent.,Feature,
The one problem I have is not with the TV but with DirectTV.,Sentiment,
There are no control codes for this set for the DirectTV remote so you must use two remotes if you want to connect this set to DirectTV. ,Enhancement,
Good value for money.,Feature,
Image quality is good (not stellar) and built-in speakers deliver good quality sound.,Feature,
Menu is quite basic.,Feature,
I love it!,Sentiment,
Everything I wanted it to be,Sentiment,
Great!,Sentiment,
Just what I wanted!!,Sentiment,
I love this tv!,Sentiment,
It only has enough for one component though.,Other,
By following the directions I was able to hook up my old nintendo 64 console to this tv but everything else has to be hdmi.,Sentiment,
Very happy with my purchase.,Sentiment,
As advertised.,Sentiment,
thanks so much,Other,
Bought this as a gift for my boys to have as a little gaming tv in their bedroom.,Sentiment,
The first one arrived on time and in great shape.,Other,
Plugged it in via HDMI to demo and pick the best picture setting.,Sentiment,
I contacted Amazon who graciously shipped out another via 2 day shipping method which arrived on a Saturday.,Other,
Quickly repacked the old TV for shipping and set up the new one.,Sentiment,
Sure enough it has the same exact issue!,Other,
"For customers reading this please note that I am no amateur and own a RCA , SHARP, VIZIO and Westinghouse TV set.",Other,
Nothing against LG and their products but this experience has definitely changed my opinion about their products.,Sentiment,
I will be returning both defective TV's for a full refund.,Other,
Buyers beware.,Other,
Nothing special.,Sentiment,
Got it for my elderly mother who was watching an old 24 screen in her bedroom.,Sentiment,

she remembers to tune into the high def channels lol.,Sentiment,
My son loves this.,Sentiment,
Love it.,Sentiment,
Bought for my daughter for Xmas,Sentiment,
"If I use it while I'm on a treadmill I use closed-captions to compensate for the audio, but for normal use the set is fine.",Sentiment,
I've had it for over three months and I'd buy it again!,Sentiment,
My son bought this for himself.,Sentiment,
Bought two of these in a post Black Friday sale for $98 each.,Sentiment,
Hooked up an older Xbox 360 over component and clarity/color/etc. are all top notch,Sentiment,
"I can't comment on how long the TV will last as I have only had them for 2 weeks, but something tells me they will outlive my expectation.",Sentiment,
"Side note, the products I purchased have a different stand than the one pictured here.",Other,
I got this as a late Christmas gift.,Sentiment,
This was a really nice purchase here at Amazon.,Other,
Picture quality is better than the 11yr old LCD TV it replaced and the sound was much better too.,Feature,Comparison
Very happy with this TV and I would recommend.,Feature,
I spent a great deal of time debating on what 32 TV to buy for my bedroom and did my research and this TV has been excellent.,Sentiment,
Sound on these small TV's you cant expect a whole ton of volume but this one has plenty of volume.,Feature,
looks just the same as 1080p that my sister has.,Comparison,
Great buy!,Other,
Absolutely so happy I went through with this buy.,Sentiment,
Absolutely worth it I was scared of what other buyers said but I've had this t.v.,Sentiment,
"Since , the middle of February not 1 thing wrong and I leave it on ALL day literally I fall asleep to the noise of a t.v.",Other,
Did just fine.,Sentiment,
Would buy again .,Other,
Never heard of this brand name just hoping it will hold up.,Sentiment,
If so it will be my go to brand in the future,Other,
Bought this tv for my mom 3months ago and it's already broken.,Sentiment,Issue
Very disappointed!,Sentiment,
This is day 1 with the new television.,Sentiment,
We could not have asked for better.,Sentiment,
Hisense makes a quality product.,Sentiment,
I will leave a more detailed review after a few weeks of use.,Other,
I HIGHLY recommend this product!,Sentiment,
A really great bonus!,Other,
I looked at manufacturer website and on 2016 models it says the 50 inch and above only have media player built in.,Other,
"I decided to just keep it, isn't noticeable enough to me.",Sentiment,
"Perfect for my bedroom, or any room in the house!",Sentiment,
"Enough inputs for anything you need...HDMI, VGA, CABLE, ANTENNA, MHL, COMPONENT, COMPOSITE..., flexibility for anything, all for a fantastic price.",Feature,
"Picture great, sound exceptional for 6 speakers",Feature,
"My old 51"" Samsung is going on 7 years without a problem, and is now in my living room to replace an LG TV I had out there",Comparison,Sentiment
"Comparing it to 4K TVs that cost three times as much, the picture is just as good for 1080p content",Comparison,Feature
"One slightly disappointing thing is that I have a Samsung 46"" TV from 2010 that actually looks better.",Comparison,
"I also haven't seen any TVs under $1,500 of this size that produce as good a picture.",Feature,
I have another smaller Samsung that I bought about a year before this one.,Sentiment,
The smaller Samsung has a little more function and the processors are noticeably quicker.,Comparison,
"It honestly looks and plays better than my Samsung 27"" PC Monitor.",Comparison,
With the older Samsung TV we never really used the smart features because it was such a pain.,Sentiment,
"Compared to the AppleTV, this has better picture quality",Comparison,
The sound quality is the same as the AppleTV,Comparison,
The LG model was cheaper than the Samsung,Comparison,Feature
I decided against the Sony because of light bleed reports against the LG because it uses an IPS display while Samsung uses a VA display,Comparison,Feature
To be honest I think my UN55JU7100 has a better picture.,Comparison,Feature
Wasn't even as good as a curved I had in 2014.,Comparison,
"We also considered the Sony X930D, and although it may be a better unit, there wasn't enough to convince us it was worth another $700.",Comparison,Feature
I had intended to buy a curved model but decided I liked this one better once I had a chance to compare side by side in a store.,Comparison,
This tv is more compared to the JS8500 just because the refresh rate is supposedly much higher than the JS7000 therefore you can't compare a 60Hz tv to a 120H,Comparison,Feature
Bad motion blur and far less colors than the js7000 it aims to replace.,Feature,Comparison
Compare this tv to any 2015 suhd tv and is hits major issues.,Comparison,
But image quality is not equal to my 50in js7000 this tries to replace,Comparison,Feature
IT is better than the other model in terms of sound,Feature,Comparison
It has good sound,Feature,
It is better than the other model,Comparison,
The model 500 does not have picture quality as good as this TV,Feature,Comparison
Both the models are comparable,Comparison,
The model has a similar price to this,Comparison,Feature
The model has similar picture quality to this,Comparison,Feature
model x800 has better display than model x600,Comparison,Feature
In terms of display this model can be compared to J700,Comparison,Feature
Though that model looks better,Comparison,
This model looks better than that,Comparison,Feature
It differes from model 600 in terms of picture quality,Comparison,Feature
I also called Sumsung Support and referenced my online support ticket ID number.,Customer Service,
"After speaking to several people and being disconnected once, Samsung arranged to have a local authorized repair technician come to my house and replace the TV screen on November 17.",Customer Service,
I was on the phone for a total of two hours with Samsung and their agents to get the entire problem resolved.,Customer Service,
"I thought maybe I would need a new one-connect box to fix this, but Samsung support (1) checked that I had the latest software, and (2) had me unplug the TV while it was ON; wait a bit, then re-plug it.",Customer Service,
"Contacted Samsung and they deemed it to have ""physical damage"" from shipping and refused to repair it.",Customer Service,
Their customer service is beyond horrible.,Customer Service,
They will do everything possible to deny a warranty claim.,Customer Service,
"If you were to order this tv directly through samsung's website, it'll ship w/in 1-3 business days, but the part that's essential to the tvs functionality takes anywhere from 5-15 business days?",Customer Service,
No problem getting it hooked up but Samsung helped me with the final setup.,Customer Service,
Very kind personnel to work with,Customer Service,
"Created a service request and was called the next morning, the robot-person on the phone asked me to repeat all of the above, it's like they didn't hear the entire story I just told them.",Customer Service,
Then then said they would be closing the service request and sending me an e-mail with troubleshooting steps (literally the same as I had already performed) and I will need to watch my TV on these settings (lvl 7 backlight) for 2-3 WEEKS and then it's MY responsibility to call them back and reference the closed service request ticket.,Customer Service,
Service is absolutely terrible.,Customer Service,
The service was fast and excellent.,Customer Service,
I was listening to Sirius radio and had it on 75 and it was clear and loud for a TV.,Customer Service,
Samsung has the best ever customer service people on their team that I have ever had the pleasure of dealing with!!,Customer Service,
"Had to call customer service for some help, they were not overly friendly.",Customer Service,
The TCL Customer service reps were rather clipped in response to questions.,Customer Service,
I spent hours on the phone with their customer service who immediately placed the blame on my internet service and would not deviate from that script.,Customer Service,
Talking to their customer service it was obvious they were not about to go off their script or have anyone come service the TV.,Customer Service,
I think their customer service is designed to deny any issues and delay any real service calls until the TV is out of warranty.,Customer Service,
I called TCL customer support they told me to check if it was on MUTE .. Of course it was not the TV was broken so i had to return it,Customer Service,
customer service I explained I have work and school and cannot stay home to return it she said okay I will receive a refund but I never received one,Customer Service,
"Customer service, however, was fantastic. Returning my first TV was easy, and I was immediately sent another that works beautifully.",Customer Service,
Set up takes a little while - don't hesitate to call their customer service if you have any issues they were awesome (I wasn't scrolling far enough to see what I needed).,Customer Service,
The TCL company send an email telling me to contact them and they would tell me how to use this television but I think because of the weekend I have not had a reply as yet.,Customer Service,
"My husband had a few questions so he had to call customer service twice and he said they had the best customer service he's ever dealt with, and in the 63 years he's lived he's dealt with a lot of customer service.",Customer Service,
"CL customer service was great, and they sent a brand new TV along with a technician to set it up, and take back the defective one.",Customer Service,
Really disappointed with this product and the customer service.,Customer Service,
It I've been tossed from TCL customer service to Roku customer service to Xfinity customer service - seriously wasted 5 hours of my life!,Customer Service,
"called TCL customer service (who were very prompt and helpful by the way) and they stated that this model (28in) only has 2, but all other models have 4 mounting screw points on the back side.",Customer Service,
UPDATE TO 5 STARS BECAUSE OF FANTASTIC CUSTOMER SERVICE.,Customer Service,
"I'M GETTING ANOTHER TV, A BIGGER ONE, AND THEY ARE JUST A JOY TO WORK WITH. WENT ABOVE AND BEYOND TO MAKE THIS RIGHT FOR ME.",Customer Service,
"HIGHLY RECOMMEND THIS COMPANY. IF YOU HAVE A PROBLEM, JUST GET IN TOUCH WITH THEM.",Customer Service,
I contacted their customer service department. Thusly were actually very nice and very helpful. ,Customer Service,
Called Amazon and told me to call TCL because it's been more than a month since I bought it. Called TCL and after doing all the absurd instructions they hung up the phone. Pathetic.,Customer Service,
"So I called the included toll-free customer service number, spoke to a USA-based customer service rep and, after verifying my purchase details with him, was told that a complete accessory kit would be sent to me at no charge.",Customer Service,
"So as far as I'm concerned, the TCL customer service experience was excellent, professional, easy to understand, knowledgeable and swift. Can't ask for more than that.",Customer Service,
I find this service to be a bit over-priced ,Feature,
The quality at first glance is higher than expected for such a cheap TV.,Feature,
"The cables are about a $100 a pop (plus tax), and they are worth it.",Feature,
Absolutely worth it ,Feature,
Very expensive,Feature,
"The smart operating system is not worth the extra money, because their is barely any apps and the operating system is hard to operate.",Feature,
his TV is so good I can't believe it doesn't cost a lot more.,Feature,
was extremely disappointed when I found out that the estimated annual energy cost was $55,Feature,
Anyway I bought one of these last week when I saw the price finally dropped to 32 grand.,Feature,
I spent $3500 for this tv and it's nothing but an overpriced HDTV that's really not that impressive.,Feature,
"I was on the edge of buying this but there was no way I could've ever afforded the $24,999.99 retail price.",Feature,
Both the shipping carton and the product label on the rear of the TV clearly identify this TV as a UN24H4000 model.,Feature,
"It's not great, and speaker volume is marginal, but both work well in a small room.",Feature,
I was shocked to learn that this TV doesn't have a headphone jack.,Feature,
Here's what I think: The TV itself is very light.,Feature,
The feet are small and hardly visible so would be essentially 'invisible' if used.,Feature,
The colors are vibrant & the display is sharp.,Feature,
I like that the border is very small so you get maximum viewing area.,Feature,
The Samsung TV is very sturdy,Feature,
the TV has a very good display,Feature,
The samsung TV can easily be mounted,Feature,
picture quality is good,Feature,
Colors are good,Feature,
Can easily be mounted,Feature,
There is no way to send audio out of this tv to a soundbar or AV receiver.,Enhancement,
Remote buttons could have been bigger.,Enhancement,
Better viewing angles would be nice.,Enhancement,
Setup experience needs to be improved.,Enhancement,
Needs more audio output ports.,Enhancement,
A better way needs to exist for mounting this on the wall.,Enhancement,
Why does this TV not come with WiFi?,Enhancement,
A larger display would have been better,Enhancement,
The setup instructions could have been clearer and less confusing.,Enhancement,
The TV should be lighter than it currently is so that it is easier to mount,Enhancement,
It should learn my favorite channels over time.,Enhancement,
Great TV but would really benefit from a sturdier base.,Enhancement,
If this TV had more apps I'd pay so much more for it.,Enhancement,
I wish it had actual buttons on the screen to control it.,Enhancement,
The remote should be made bigger since it's too easily lost right now.,Enhancement,
Remote design needs to be more intuitive,Enhancement,
More color options would be great.,Enhancement,
A thinner bezel would make this the complete package.,Enhancement,
I wish they offered this in 4K resolution.,Enhancement,
Adding bluetooth connectivity would be amazing!,Enhancement,
Being able to control this from my phone would be a great feature.,Enhancement,
A thinner screen would be nice.,Enhancement,
A better way to change display settings that is faster and more intuitive would be a huge bonus.,Enhancement,
Different screen modes for gaming vs. movies vs. everyday TV would be a nice addition,Enhancement,
Customer service being done by a person instead of a robot would have made the experience 100 times better.,Enhancement,
I wish I could watch Netflix in PIP,Enhancement,
I wish I had the ability to stream my own content from my PC without wires.,Enhancement,
More connectivity options are needed.,Enhancement,
Adding a harddrive into the TV would be a good touch.,Enhancement,
"this needs to be designed better, it is just too ugly right now.",Enhancement,
Instructions for use should be clearer.,Enhancement,
A higher refresh rate would put this TV in a much more premium category.,Enhancement,
They need to reduce motion blur in the next model they release,Enhancement,
Thinner bezels please!,Enhancement,
Please add an internet browser and keyboard support!,Enhancement,
Reducing lag would be my number one concern when releasing the new model,Enhancement,
Adding speakers that actually sound good would make this the ultimate purchase,Enhancement,
I would really like to see more focus on the build quality.,Enhancement,
The settings menu's really should be cleaned up and simplified,Enhancement,
Voice controls would be a welcome addition!,Enhancement,
Adding a camera for Skype would be really cool.,Enhancement,
A more polished OS would make this perfect.,Enhancement,
"The remote is pretty lightweight and feels somewhat ""cheap.""",Feature,
Something that sounds small but will drive you nuts is the remote.,Feature,
don't like the start up lag time.,Feature,
native set sound quality isn't very good,Feature,
terrible Android TV experience,Feature,
Buggy and troubled setup,Feature,
The tv has really weak sound to begin with and you have to adjust it when switching from tv to other devices.,Feature,
volume control sucks,Feature,
 The stand consists of two flmsy plastic legs that are very likely to break off,Feature,
"The built in Wi-Fi was poor,",Feature,
Horrible audio quality,Feature,
We are lucky to get connected to our wifi at all on these and then the signal is perpetually dropped. ,Feature,
"Over all it seems nice, but the motion blur engine is not quite up to par and you will notice some artifacts on live sports and news broadcast",Feature,
The remote that comes with this unit is the worse remote I've ever owned.,Feature,
Unfortunately there is noticeable input lag.,Feature,
EXTREMELY slow and takes FOREVER to boot up after being turned on.,Feature,
Buggy smart software that crashes and reboots irregularly.,Feature,
The most remarkable quality I've found with the television is its theater-like picture.,Feature,
Set up is pretty much self explanatory and you have a minimal amount of selections to make and the TV does the rest to set itself up.,Feature,
"I am impressed with the resolution and clarity, since this is a brand I haven't heard of. Visually very impressive, good clean resolution.",Feature,
"the best, reliable, great picture, well built, all the necessary features",Feature,
Very fast apps and processor. ,Feature,
The TV is easy to set up and use. The picture quality right out of the box was quite good and I was able to enhance it by using the lab settings that Consumerreports.org has for this model on its website. ,Feature,
"Very light weight so easy to hang, sharp picture quality, and pretty good sound coming from stereo speakers mounted in the bottom of the TV facing down. ",Feature,
"his tv has been wonderful for me. The picture quality is above average, the settings we're easy to configure,",Feature,
" It prompted me very intuitively. One thing I discovered a bit later is that under the center front of the TV itself, there is a switch",Feature,
Has a true native 1080P capability in a small 22 inch LED monitor. Smallest available size with native 1080p for tight areas.,Feature,
"Thin, light, easy to set up, navigation through menu is simple. Bright and colorful ",Feature,
"I was hesitant because I had read the reviews and they were not great. I received my TV yesterday, and it has been great.",Feature,
The feet of the base are fairly wide though it fit perfectly on a stand we had used previously for a 60 in DLP TV.,Feature,
"My TV has a perfect refresh rate and a nice bright LED back-lit picture.. 3HDMI inputs, a component input and a regular good old fashioned AV (Red/White/Yellow)input make this unit very versatile.",Feature,
"Size is great, and the bezel is very thin",Feature,
Still and slow moving moments look great,Feature,
"Picture options are surprisingly high for an entry level set, if you have a calibration dvd you are all set.",Feature,
 had high hopes for this TV after reading the reviews but 5 minutes out of the box i got the base installed and attempted to turn it on to find the remote doesnt work with the shrink wrapped batteries it came with.,Issue,
"On my specimen, there is noticeable back-light infiltration, initially in the lower and upper right corners. ",Issue,
"Screen will go black, randomly for roughly 5 seconds.",Issue,
We owned one for 10 months and went zebra striped. ,Issue,
I would. I have had the tv for less than 6 months and it is torn up.,Issue,
"Box was damaged, screen casing (black plastic that holds the tv in place) was damaged. ",Issue,
When we turned it on the picture had crazy colored lines across and no image on the screen. ,Issue,
The screen was broken.,Issue,
That is until I got it home and realized that the TV had white spots on it. ,Issue,
"That replacement worked for about 4 hours, then the screen started showing black, horizontal lines moving up and down the screen and gradually became worse until the television wasn't viewable.",Issue,
"This television was working for about 24 hours worth of viewing, then the picture faded into bright green and white. Completely unusable.",Issue,
Within the first month I was having issues with the video and audio not working. ,Issue,
After about a week of that the audio went completely out. I contacted sharp and opened a case. It took them about a month but they sent a TV repair man out to replace the mother board.,Issue,
had to return it due to large scratch on the screen,Issue,
" I have put it to use just few days ago, and all of a sudden there was no Audio coming out from the TV's internal speakers, when I try to stream content from Netflix, Youtube or any other built in app.",Issue,
"TV randomly reboots itself, sometimes a few times in a row",Issue,
First issue was that on several streams there were odd green lines flickering on the screen.,Issue,
After the third day I started losing sound when switching from Netflix to cable. ,Issue,
There is some minor light bleed on the edges and you can see the led light zones on all black screens,Issue,
sound making that horrible plastic speaker crackling sound after 45 days making it ineligible for return,Issue,
Makes loud popping noises while fast forwarding and randomly freezes even while sound is still on.,Issue,
"The plastic frame around the screen does not meet all the way around, leaving a horizontal line of light shining through on the top right screen area",Issue,
TV sometime has no volume. No idea what is happening,Issue,
I got a defective screen that I didn't notice until I saw an all white or mostly light grey screen and now I notice it all the time. ,Issue,
Out of the box there is a large dark vertical bar right center.,Issue,
Second tv came in and the screen is entirely busted!,Issue,
Arrived broken.,Issue,
Arrived with the screen broken where it meets the frame from poor assembly at the factory and an obvious lack of inspection. ,Issue,
Worked fine for about a month (at which point it's ineligible for a return) then the picture started flashing in and out.,Issue,
Huge discoloration on the upper left-hand side .,Issue,
After two months the panel went bad; there is a 3-inch horizontal bar along the bottom of the television that flashes random colors.,Issue,
wouldn't started yesterday with horizontal lines and today the screen is completely black.,Issue,
"The first week of Febuary the scrambling and distortion began to get worse, lasting longer and longer, until it was only scrambling when you turned on the set. ",Issue,
"Also, as of 1/18/2016 the TV now flickers slightly until I tap it on its side.",Issue,
Dead pixels throughout and the right side of the screen was dead. Huge disappointment.,Issue,
"But the annoying thing is, the first one I got, there were two gray shadow area at the low center of the screen, they were too obvious to be ignored. So after another week of waiting, I got a replacement. But I found there's a dead pixel surrounding by a 'bubble' underneath the panel, just right after I spent half an hour to get it mounted on the wall. It looks like a bubble under a window screen.",Issue,
Not even four months later and there is a horizontal blue line on the left side of the screen.,Issue,
"One month out of warranty, and a blue line randomly appeared on the screen indicating a pixel defect. ",Issue,
"white lines on screen, poor quality pictures.",Issue,
"80 days after purchase, the otherwise fine unit suddenly emitted a high-decibel static death shriek",Issue,
bout 6 months in it started having display issues where the display would cut in and out until finally it just stopped working all together,Issue,
backlight died after 7 months. ,Issue,
Bought this tv 4 days ago it already went dead ?,Issue,
Had mine about 10 months now and it now goes through this sequence of scrolling all of the TV inputs continuously.,Issue,
"However, today Sunday April 24, 2016...vertical lines appeared on the screen from the center stretching to the right and patterns like a bar code.",Issue,
"The picture was immediately grainy, snowy, had sporadic green flashes through the screen and occasionally a black screen.",Issue,
After only having this TV for 1 month I noticed a huge line across the screen.,Issue,
"I was very excited about getting my new tv, only to find out that the screen was broken.",Issue,
it worked for a month and went black screen and no matter how much turning off and on or doing anything nothing would get it too work so i returned it...,Issue,
