    "# 1. Gathering data\n",
    "The first step is to find a data set that needs to be analyzed. The data needs to be stored so that the rest of the flow can use it. It is recommended to use a database and store the data in JSON format but any way of saving the data is fine as long as it can be accessed throughout the flow. Examples include just storing it in a JSON file, SQL database, NoSQL database, CSV file, etc. For the purposes of this starter kit, the data is being stored in a Cloudant NoSQL database (available on Bluemix http://bluemix.net/) and that is the simplest way to get started and requires the fewest changes to be made to the scripts. We offer a few scripts to help push and pull from this database to make it even easier.\n",

Very Impressed with the shipping time, it arrived a few days earlier than expected...  within a week of use however it started freezing up... could of just been a glitch in that unit.  Worked great when it worked!  Will work great for the normal person as well but does have the \\\"trucker\\\" option. (the big truck routes - tells you when a scale is coming up ect...)  Love the bigger screen, the ease of use, the ease of putting addresses into memory.  Nothing really bad to say about the unit with the exception of it freezing which is probably one in a million and that's just my luck.  I contacted the seller and within minutes of my email I received a email back with instructions for an exchange! VERY impressed all the way around!\", \n",
